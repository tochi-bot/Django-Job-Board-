### Challenges Faced
## Setting Up User Authentication
**Issue:**
Integrating Django's built-in authentication system and customizing it to fit the project's requirements was challenging, particularly in managing user roles (job seekers and employers).
**Solution:**
Research and Documentation: Extensively read Django documentation on authentication and authorization.

## Challenge 2: Handling File Uploads (CV Uploads)
**Issue:**
Ensuring that the file uploads (like CVs) are handled securely and are stored correctly was a key concern.
**Solution:**
Media Settings: Configured Django settings to handle media files, including setting up MEDIA_URL and MEDIA_ROOT.

Validation: Implemented validation on file uploads to ensure only specific file types and sizes are accepted.

### Challenge 3: Database Migrations
**Issue**
Managing database migrations, especially with frequent changes to models, led to conflicts and inconsistent database states.
**Solution:**
Frequent Migrations: Created and applied migrations frequently to minimize the risk of conflicts.

Resetting Migrations: In extreme cases, reset migrations by deleting all migration files and the database, then re-running makemigrations and migrate


### Recommendations
**Notifications:** The implementation of Django Channels for real-time notifications was started but not completed in my project. I recommend using third-party services like Pusher or Firebase for push notifications to enhance real-time communication and updates.
**Chat Application:** Integrate Django Channels to handle WebSockets for real-time chat functionality. This would enable users to engage in live conversations, making the platform more interactive.
**Messaging:** A messaging system where users can send and receive messages was initiated but not completed. I recommend continuing this development to provide a robust communication tool for users. Consider using Django Channels for real-time messaging and Celery for handling asynchronous tasks like sending email notifications for new messages.
